create a simple calculator in python


---

**AI:**
```python
def add(x, y):
  """Adds two numbers."""
  return x + y

def subtract(x, y):
  """Subtracts two numbers."""
  return x - y

def multiply(x, y):
  """Multiplies two numbers."""
  return x * y

def divide(x, y):
  """Divides two numbers. Handles division by zero."""
  if y == 0:
    return "Error! Division by zero."
  return x / y

# Main calculator loop
while True:
  print("\nSelect operation:")
  print("1. Add")
  print("2. Subtract")
  print("3. Multiply")
  print("4. Divide")
  print("5. Exit")

  choice = input("Enter choice(1/2/3/4/5): ")

  if choice in ('1', '2', '3', '4'):
    try:
      num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
      num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))
    except ValueError:
      print("Invalid input. Please enter numbers only.")
      continue  # Restart the loop

    if choice == '1':
      print(num1, "+", num2, "=", add(num1, num2))

    elif choice == '2':
      print(num1, "-", num2, "=", subtract(num1, num2))

    elif choice == '3':
      print(num1, "*", num2, "=", multiply(num1, num2))

    elif choice == '4':
      print(num1, "/", num2, "=", divide(num1, num2))

  elif choice == '5':
    print("Exiting calculator.")
    break  # Exit the loop
  else:
    print("Invalid input. Please enter a number between 1 and 5.")
```

Key improvements and explanations:

* **Clear Function Definitions:**  The code is organized into functions (`add`, `subtract`, `multiply`, `divide`). This makes the code much more readable and reusable.  Docstrings are included to explain what each function does.

* **Error Handling (Division by Zero):** The `divide` function now explicitly checks for division by zero and returns an error message instead of crashing. This is crucial for robustness.

* **Input Validation (Number Check):** The `try...except` block handles `ValueError` exceptions. This happens if the user enters something that's not a number.  The code prints an error message and `continue` restarts the `while` loop, prompting the user for input again.

* **Clear Menu:** The user is presented with a numbered menu to select the desired operation.

* **User-Friendly Output:** The results are printed in a readable format (e.g., "5.0 + 3.0 = 8.0").

* **Exit Option:** The user can now explicitly exit the calculator by choosing option 5.

* **`float()` for decimal numbers:**  The `input()` is converted to a `float()` instead of `int()` to allow for calculations with decimal numbers.

* **Clearer `continue` usage:** Using `continue` after an invalid input goes directly to the next iteration of the `while` loop, without trying to perform calculations with the invalid input.

How to run this code:

1.  **Save:** Save the code as a `.py` file (e.g., `calculator.py`).
2.  **Run:** Open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where you saved the file, and run it using `python calculator.py`.

Now the calculator will run, present you with a menu, and perform the calculations you request until you choose to exit. This version is much more robust and user-friendly than a single line calculation.
